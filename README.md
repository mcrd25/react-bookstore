# React Bookstore

> A simple bookstore management tool built with React and Redux

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)
Magic-books Inc. is a fictional company based in Germany. They requested my help to build the front-end of an application that will help them organize and manage their bookstore. They want it to be fast, dynamic and responsive to their actions and therefore I decided to build it with React & Redux.

## Built With

- JavaScript (ES6),
- React,Redux, [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app), React-DOM
